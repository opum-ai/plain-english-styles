// The runaway guard, watched actually firing.
//
// `maxBudgetUsd` used to hold this line: the SDK stopped a cell once it had
// spent $2. That number was never money anyone was charged — the harness runs
// on a subscription and `total_cost_usd` is a list-price valuation of tokens —
// so it went with the rest of the cost tracking. What it was really doing was
// bounding a cell that never finishes, and that job still needs doing.
//
// A wall-clock timeout is the only replacement the SDK can enforce. `maxTurns`
// bounds tool rounds but not the time inside one, and `taskBudget` merely tells
// the model how many tokens it has left and asks it to pace itself — advisory,
// and useless against exactly the wedged loop a guard exists for.
//
// These tests exist because a guard nobody has observed fail is not evidence.
// Each one drives `runCell` to a real abort through the injected `query` seam
// and asserts the row that comes back, rather than reading the source and
// concluding it looks right.
