  run      evaluate the matrix and write results/<stamp>/{rows,summary,run,report.md},
           re-written after every completed cell so a killed run keeps what it measured.
           run.json says whether the rows beside it are the whole matrix
  improve  loop: measure -> rewrite the style -> re-measure -> keep if train up and holdout flat,
           then validate the winner on the reserve split and roll back to v0 if it regresses.
           Runs matrix.improve.models, NOT matrix.models — one list per iteration per candidate
  score    re-score saved transcripts offline after changing checks.mjs
  judge    re-judge saved replies with several judge models, several times each, and
           split judge-call variance from reply variance. Runs no cell — judge calls only.
           --judgements re-derives a finished judge run's figures offline, spending nothing
  audit    check every style file's stated caps against contracts.json; exit 1 on disagreement
  interval a paired 95% Student-t interval between two saved runs on the same cases —
           pairs rows by case + model, averaging repeats within a pair. --before/--after
           each take a comma-separated list of rows.json paths, pooled before pairing.
           --rows alone (also comma-separable, unlike score/judge's single-path --rows)
           gives a single-sample 95% interval over one run's per-case means instead of
           a before/after comparison — n is the case count, not the row count, so more
           repeats per case narrows this only a little; it narrows a paired comparison
           a lot. Rows whose cell errored are dropped first — they still carry scores —
           and the count is printed to stderr. Runs no cell — reads saved rows only

  --help   print this and exit, on any subcommand

 * that second loss is fixed, but the time itself is not recoverable. Any
