# Close the style quality gaps

## Goal

Two weaknesses survived every optimizer pass because neither is a wording
problem. Both need new content in the style files themselves.

**Scenario coverage.** `agentic-fix-verify` and `conv-decision-holdout` are the
two weakest cases in the pool. On the text that ships today they score, judge,
pooled across the three styles: 50.0 Opus / 40.0 Sonnet and 48.3 / 46.7
respectively (run `00-44-03`). No style file said how to report a session
containing a dozen tool calls, or how to handle a decision where neither option
is clearly right. The optimizer can only re-express rules that already exist, so
six rewrites across two rounds left this untouched.

**COS-1 wrote those rules by hand, and the gap stayed open.** All three style
files now state both, and the judge grades against them — it quotes the new
sections by name. The score did not follow: 46.2 / 42.0 / 51.2 / 54.7 against a
bar of 65 (run `00-48-49`). A second, more forceful pass scored *below* the
original text and was reverted (run `01-03-21`). What the judge's violations
show instead is that **reply length is the binding constraint** — 71–83% of cells
overrun their style's word cap in every arm — and that the agentic half of this
measurement is contaminated by the harness handing the judge the whole turn
rather than the final message. Both are recorded in `FINDINGS.md` under *A
content gap that new content did not close*.

**Beginner prose.** Beginner is the weakest style by a wide margin. Measured on
the standard case set, ten cells each, now across all four model tiers:

| style | rules (opus / sonnet / haiku / fable) | judge (opus / sonnet / haiku / fable) |
|---|---|---|
| advanced | 97.8 / 96.8 / 96.0 / 97.9 | 73.9 / 66.0 / 52.9 / 78.3 |
| intermediate | 94.2 / 95.6 / 94.3 / 93.1 | 63.9 / 72.6 / 62.2 / 67.7 |
| **beginner** | 91.5 / 92.3 / 90.9 / 91.4 | **45.9 / 48.4 / 37.5 / 53.9** |

It follows its own rules at over 90% and still reads worst. Judge complaints
centre on vague next-steps, restated ideas, and reverting to a helper-assistant
register on follow-up turns. Raising its `judgeWeight` to 0.5 did not let the
optimizer fix it — both cross-model rewrites raised train by roughly 6 points and
dropped holdout by roughly 8, so the keep rule rejected them and the loop
converged having changed nothing.

**COS-4 rewrote the file, and the beginner row above no longer describes it.**
Two things had to be corrected before the work could start. That row's Opus and
Sonnet judge figures were graded with the judge told a 15-word sentence cap the
file never stated — `FINDINGS.md`, *The judge column carries a defect the rules
column had corrected* — and COS-1 had since added two sections. A fresh arm on
the *pre-rewrite* file read 58.7 Opus / 70.7 Sonnet, not 45.9 / 48.4, and the two
causes of that difference are not separable. (Post-rewrite figures are below;
"shipped text" from here on means the rewritten file.)

The defect underneath was not wording and not missing content: beginner's rules
contradicted each other, and the judge enforced both sides. Its 80-word budget
was scoped to status updates while the harness applied it to every reply; its
demands for analogies and for explaining what a thing *is* were unbounded and
cost 15–25 words each; "skip all internal details" was read as forbidding the
evidence its own status shape requires. And nothing in the file said which of its
shapes a reply should take, so 10 of the 40 judge violations on the three weakest
cases in run `02-10-45` say the reply is missing the three beats — on replies
that are not status updates, and spread across all three cases (3 / 3 / 4).

The rewrite is measured over 144 cells in six arms, 114 of them in the two paired
comparisons below. **Rules and reply length moved and are established** — rules +5.2 shared and +7.7 on reserve
(t=7.06), reply words −42.0 and −55.7, over-cap share 40.0% → 14.3%, and rules on
the shipped text at 98.5 / **97.7** — 97.4 before COS-15 taught `no_jargon` to
forgive a glossed first use, which also shifts both rules deltas by under a
point; see the footnote in `FINDINGS.md`. Still the highest beginner has recorded. **The judge
did not move**: +1.3 [−15.0, +17.6]. Sonnet pooled over 35 cells reads 58.1
[50.5, 65.6], below this story's 70% bar and established as below it, so that
criterion is not met and COS-4 is parked rather than closed.

**COS-16 re-measured the same bytes at 150 cells a model and the judge figures
moved.** Runs `19-42-55` (the five shared cases) and `19-53-49` (the six reserve
cases), 300 cells each and no errored cell in either, read rules **98.9 / 97.4**
and judge **66.8 / 60.9** on the shared five. Opus falls 7.1 points from COS-4's
73.9 and Sonnet rises 2.8 from 58.1; both land inside COS-4's stated intervals,
so this is those intervals closing at the sample size the claims needed rather
than a contradiction. It matters for the bar: 73.9 sits above this story's 70%
and 66.8 sits below it, so **the bar is now missed on both models, not one**.

**COS-16 has since changed those bytes.** The shipped file is now the three-edit candidate (sha256 `86451ddb`). At the same 150 cells a model it reads rules **99.2 / 97.4** and judge **66.1 / 60.9** on the shared five (run `2026-08-20T03-03-26`), and every paired interval against `19-42-55` contains zero — the figures above stand as current within noise, but `19-42-55` measures the text COS-16 replaced, not the text that ships.

**COS-18 asked whether the other two files carry the same defects. They do,
unevenly.** Nobody had looked before. Run `2026-08-20T12-12-10`, 600 cells at 150
a style a model on the shared five, 0 errored:

| pattern | intermediate | advanced |
|---|---|---|
| reply budget scoped to one shape | **carries** | clean |
| unbounded content requirement | **carries** | does not bite |
| no reply-shape router | **carries** | **carries** |
| a rule forbidding what another requires | **carries** | carries, weakly |

Advanced is the negative control the task expected on the two patterns it was
predicted for, and not a control at all on the other two.

"Clean" and "does not bite" are different claims and the difference is worth
keeping. On the scoped budget advanced is clean in the strict sense: it states
its cap for "the whole reply" and extends it to a decision reply by name, and
across 300 cells the grader never once described that cap as belonging to a
status update. On the unbounded requirement it is not clean but unpunished — the
file does carry one unrationed demand, for risk and blast radius, and the judge
fires on it in 1.5% and 1.0% of violations against intermediate's 7.9% and 3.4%.
That is at the floor rather than at zero, and a fix elsewhere that freed up
attention could plausibly raise it.

**The clearest result is the router.** All 138 shape violations in the run — 39
and 47 on intermediate, 22 and 30 on advanced — fall on cases that are not status
updates. **Not one falls on a status update.** COS-4 found the same concentration
on beginner at 10 of 40; at fifteen times the sample it is total. Both files
define four shapes and neither says which a reply should take, and the judge names
the mechanism itself: *"the guide's status-update format is the only structure
defined, and the reply instead reads as a lecture."* That is COS-31.

**The method finding is the part worth carrying forward, because the obvious
measure gives the wrong answer.** Counting over-length violations makes advanced
look worse than intermediate: 7.7% of its Sonnet violations against 3.1%, and
7.5% against 6.1% on Opus.
Advanced overruns its cap while stating it correctly, so the symptom exists
without the defect underneath it, and violation counts cannot tell the two apart.
Three measures can. Intermediate's non-status replies average 1.43× and 1.13× its
cap where advanced's average 0.95× and 0.85× — inside it. The grader attaches the
cap to *updates* in 14 of 20 and 8 of 9 of intermediate's over-length violations
and in **0 of advanced's 43**, every one read by hand; the word "update" is in
neither `contracts.json` nor the judge's hard-limits line, so it can only have come
from the file. And intermediate breaks its cap about three times as often while
being flagged for it about half as often. A scoped cap is both broken more and
enforced less.

The same lesson bit twice. Reading the two files ranked their contradiction
defects backwards: advanced's is far sharper on the page — a diff permitted in one
line and forbidden in another — and fires two to four times *less* often, because
the reply it governs is one the model seldom attempts. How bad a contradiction
looks did not predict how often it bites, which is exactly why the task required
judge violations from a real arm rather than a reading.

**The fix for intermediate's scoped cap is measured and did not ship.** One edit,
re-scoping the 100-word budget out of the status-update section and dropping its
"when things are normal" hatch, moved rules **+3.0 [+0.1, +5.8]** and mean reply
length **−24.6 [−46.4, −2.8]**, both clear of zero, taking non-status replies from
142.9 to 96.7 words on Opus and rules to 99.1 / 97.1 — parity with advanced, which
intermediate has trailed on every tier of the table above. Its reserve validation
could not be completed: one arm was destroyed by the monthly spend limit and its
retry was stopped when throughput fell to roughly 0.7 cells a minute. Unmeasured
text does not ship, and the reserve split is where two earlier candidate rewrites
failed after passing everything else, so the edit waits in **COS-33** with its
recipe, its hash and its four intervals rather than going in on the strength of
the split that did pass.

**The judge did not move, for the third time running.** COS-4 on beginner
(+1.3 [−15.0, +17.6]), COS-16's shipped candidate (−0.3 [−3.5, +3.0]), and now
this (+2.5 [−2.8, +7.8]). Three tasks, two style files, and every measured gain in
compliance has bought nothing the judge rewards. The open question at the foot of
these notes — what the judge is responding to — is no longer a beginner-specific
one.

**COS-31 gave intermediate a reply-shape router and it shipped; advanced's did
not.** The same three-bullet router, measured on its own at 150 cells a model,
cut intermediate's shape violations on non-status cases from 81 → 52 on Opus and
92 → 50 on Sonnet (run `2026-10-05T18-43-33`, a reconstructed classifier applied
to both sides). On advanced it did nothing (38 → 47, 46 → 43), so advanced keeps
no router and its "Beat 3 always appears" stays inside the status section it
governs. Intermediate's intervals are the first in this story where the judge
moves clear of zero: +4.5 [+0.8, +8.2] shared, +12.3 [+5.4, +19.2] on reserve
(run `2026-10-05T19-04-48`). **Most of that is probably drift, not the router.**
Both baselines are one to two months older than the after-runs, and the only two
reserve pairs with a same-day baseline (Sonnet, `2026-10-05T21-50-08`) read +3.1
and −0.1. What the router has established is the drop in shape violations and no
regression on any metric, not a judge gain.


**Two tiers were added after this story was written, and neither rescued it.**
(This paragraph describes the pre-COS-4 file; the rewrite is measured on Opus and
Sonnet only.) Beginner was last on the judge on every one of the four, and the
best score any model reached was Fable's 53.9 — the most capable tier available,
still 16 points under the bar. A more capable model did not write better beginner
prose from that file, which is what would have to be true for the gap to be a
model problem rather than a content one. COS-7 also measured the mechanism directly: on the
five shared cases beginner averaged 135 words on Opus, 132 on Fable, 113 on Haiku
and 103 on Sonnet, against a stated cap of 80, while every tier wrote comfortably
*inside* the looser 120-word advanced cap. The caps were being read as an
audience signal, and the signal pointed the wrong way — "explain this simply"
answered with more words, not fewer. **COS-4 reversed that on Opus and Sonnet**
without touching the cap: 61 words on the same five cases, 14.3% over. The two
untested tiers are Haiku and Fable.

## Acceptance criteria

- Every style file states how to report a multi-tool session in one final
  message, and how to handle a decision where neither option is clearly better.
- New harness cases cover both scenarios so the gap stays measured.
- Judge score on the two weak cases exceeds 65% on both models.
- Beginner judge score exceeds 70% on both models with rules held at or above
  92%.
- Changes validated on cases held out of every optimizer split.

## Notes

The composite scores in the table above are not comparable across styles: each
carries a different `judgeWeight`. The rules and judge columns are directly
comparable, and they are what this story is scored on.

**"On both models" above means Opus and Sonnet, and the tasks are where that
binds.** COS-1's AC #4 and COS-4's AC #1 name the two models explicitly, so
adding Haiku and Fable does not move either bar — beginner climbs to 70% from
45.9 and 48.4, not from Haiku's 37.5. This story's looser phrasing predates the
two extra tiers and is subordinate to the task text. Widening the bars to every
tier would be a scope change, and nobody has asked for one.

Beginner may need a different instrument rather than a different wording. Its
rules pass while its prose does not, which is the signature of a style whose
stated rules do not capture what makes it good. **COS-4 half-settled this.** The
rules did not capture it, and three self-contradictions plus a missing shape
router were found and fixed. Fixing them moved everything the deterministic side
measures and nothing the judge measures, so what the judge is responding to in
beginner prose is still unidentified.

COS-8 narrowed where to look. Sentence length is not the lever: tightening
beginner's stated cap to 12 words changed nothing measurable on either model
(+0.25 words, 95% CI [−0.83, +1.34], re-derived after COS-10 re-segmented the same
rows; +0.26, [−0.77, +1.29] before) and did not move the judge. Reply length is
the constraint that actually binds — beginner averaged 119 words against its
stated 80, with half its replies over — and where the two can be told apart, the
judge tracks reply length far more strongly than sentence length. Any attempt at
COS-4 that works on sentence-level wording alone is likely to repeat the six
optimizer rewrites that already failed.

**COS-4 closed the reply-length half of that and the judge did not follow.** Mean
reply length fell 103 → 61 words and the over-cap share 40.0% → 14.3%, both
significant on two disjoint case sets, while the judge moved +1.3 [−15.0, +17.6].
The correlation COS-8 measured is real; length is evidently not the *cause*, or
not the only one.

**The measurement lesson is the durable part.** Per-cell judge SD is 22 to 32, so
a ten-cell arm — the size every judge figure in this project rests on — carries a
95% interval about 30 points wide. Sonnet read 70.7, 65.8, 74.1 and 55.0 across
four arms of the same five cases. Placing a style above a 70% bar with confidence
does not place a score above a bar — Sonnet measures 58.1 and no arm size moves a
point estimate. What it gives you is precision: narrowing one arm's 95%
half-width to ±7 points takes 49 cells per model on beginner and ±4 takes 148;
detecting a real 5-point difference between two arms takes 189 cells per arm.
Any future bar of this kind should be sized before it is agreed.

COS-20 recomputed those from measured variance components rather than one pooled
SD, which moved them by at most two cells and added two qualifications. They are
beginner's — ±4 costs 169 cells on intermediate and 207 on advanced. And the bar
itself is judge-dependent: Haiku grades the same beginner replies +18.01 [+12.34,
+23.68] above Sonnet, against a Sonnet-to-bar gap of 11.9 points, so a bar has to
name the judge it is stated against.
